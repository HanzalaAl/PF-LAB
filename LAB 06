//Which loop system would be better for user input. Justify your answer by creating a program that takes a value and adds it to a variable and prints it repeatedly until the user enters a zero value.

//we will use do while loop so the program executes atleast once 
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    
    int num , sum = 0;
    
    do{
        printf("enter a number: ");
        scanf("%d", &num);
        
        sum = sum + num;
        printf("%d current total: ", sum);
        
    }while(num != 0);
    
    printf("%d final total: ",sum);
    return 0;
}
